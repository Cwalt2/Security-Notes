# Security-Notes

## Purpose

This repo is to record my notes taking various courses, practice tests, and watching material related to the five different CompTIA objectives for the Security+ exam.

## Goals

My initial goal for this exam is to study for about four weeks and take the exam with confidence.

## Progress

I will be posting my progress such as practice exam scores, notes, little projects, and exam pass/fail score

> I am keeping this repo open in the event someone else needs to use these to determine what works for them and what helped me pass the real exam.
